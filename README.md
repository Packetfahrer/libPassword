libPassword
===========

#### This is some of the messiest code I've written, done almost purely in the wee hours of the morning (like 3am - 5am). 

#### To be honest, it's a miracle that it works halfway decently.

#### With a bit of help, this will hopefully get to the point that any passcode-related tweak will be possible in like 20 lines of code.
----------  

A library for the iOS Password, by myself and Zac (twodayslate)
 

This is working, but there are a few issues. I can use all the help I can get, and I'm hoping this will become a public effort.

Things that are broken:

  - TouchID
  - Passcode Lock Delay
  - Switcher Animations (I've never had it happen but apparently it does)

Things that are working:

  - Unlock with/without the code
  - Lock with/without the code
  - Toggle the code On/Off

To-do list:

  - Clean up code (a lot)
  - Detect when a certain password is entered
  - Accept multiple passcodes
  - etc.
